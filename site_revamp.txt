Question:
The company Enterprise Systems LLC has a legacy system developed 5 years
ago, and a lot of clients are using it. Lately, the stakeholders came out with a
whole new set of features to the product in order to open a new market
branch. The software engineers evaluated the legacy software and concluded
that it is excessively coupled (maccarronic code). In your opinion, whatâ€™s the
best strategy: revamp the software ou evolve the legacy code? Elaborate.


Answer:
When we say that legacy code is using excessively coupled code, then revamp is always best way to go because when an application is closely coupled, there is a lot of code duplication, very less modularization.
Even small changes in such app can be tedious.
Adding new features to such project will only increase complexity.
Tighly coupled coding is a bad coding practice.
Another reason to go for revamp is, the legacy app was built 5 years ago. So, possibly the framework on which this app was built must have gone out of date and support for that framework might not be available anymore.

Upgrading such app will have following advantages:

- We can build the app with latest framework / tools available
- We would be knowing the challenges faced during previous development cycle, so we can plan application architecture accordingly
- Application support would improve as we would be upgrading to latest framework
- Integrating new features would be easier in future
- Application would become more stable
